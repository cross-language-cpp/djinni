# Djinni is still alive and active developed!


**The monolithic djinni repository has been split into extra repositories for each component.**

* [generator](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-generator)
* [support-lib](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-support-lib)
* [intellij-plugin](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni-intellij-plugin)

Please **[read here about the reasons](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/djinni/issues/17)** for this decision.

Additionally there is now also a [djinni asdf plugin](https://github.com/cross-language-cpp/asdf-djinni), and further new repositories might follow.
